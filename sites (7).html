                  Statue of Parakramabahu I, located near the Pothgul Vehera in Polonnaruwa is a stone sculpture dating back to the Polonnaruwa period of ancient Sri Lanka. Its identity is uncertain, although the widely accepted theory is that it is a statue of Parakramabahu I. However, it has also been suggested as the statue of a sage. Carved on a large boulder, the statue depicts a majestic figure with a grave expression, holding a book or yoke in his hands.</p>
				<p>
   				  The statue was built presumably in the 12th century, during the reign of Parakramabahu I. The statue of Parakramabahu I is one of the best stone sculptures belonging to the Polonnaruwa period. The 11-foot-2-inch-high (3.40 m) statue is carved in high relief on a large boulder, with full use being made of its height.

               <p>Its upper body is bare except for a single thread worn over the left shoulder. A long object is held in the hands. The 		statue's face carries a grave expression, with half-closed eyes, a high forehead, a long beard and a moustache. The 			shoulders of the statue are rounded, suggesting "extraordinary strength". The right leg is relaxed with the right knee bent 	forward slightly. The left leg carries the weight of the body, while the hip is also slightly inclined to the left. 			According to archaeologist Senarath Paranavitana, this statue is "the very embodiment of strength, majesty and dignity"
